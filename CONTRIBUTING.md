# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

We follow [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) as described [here](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

## Guidelines

- Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
- We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), so update the [ChangeLog](CHANGELOG.md) accordingly
- Please use meaningful commit messages. If you had multiple commits, [squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) them or create branches for features
- You may also need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts
